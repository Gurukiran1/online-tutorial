What is Technology?
Technology (which is basically derived from the Greek word ‘technologia’) is an art, skill or ability, which is used to create and develop products and acquire knowledge.

Scientists used their knowledge to develop technology and then used technology to develop Science; so, because of this reason science and technology are an integrated term in today’s world.

Consider the following points to understand the relationship between Science and Technology −

The science stream is further divided into 2 branches, namely medical (PCB) and non-medical (PCM) science stream.

The difference between the two lies in the choice of the third subject. While Physics and Chemistry are compulsory for both, the medical stream offers Biology as the 3rd compulsory subject, and the non-medical stream offers Mathematics. English is common to all streams and students can take up any optional subject to meet a total of 5 subjects.

Here is a detailed look into the compulsory subjects in the Science stream:

1. Physics
Physics is among the oldest academic fields in the world and is the science of matter, motion, energy, and force. It focuses on understanding how the universe behaves. Advances in the field of physics enable advancements in technologies, such as the study of electromagnetism, thermodynamics, mechanics, nuclear physics and solid-state physics.

Studying physics at Class 11-12 level will help you develop observational, analytical, investigatory and decision making skills, along with conceptual understanding, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Examples of a few topics you will study are:

Kinematics
Laws of Motion
Thermodynamics
Electrostatics
Electromagnetic Waves
Electronic Devices
After studying physics there are a variety of career options available, including working as a physicist, astronaut, data scientist, technician, and engineer.

2. Chemistry
Everything in the universe is made out of atoms and matter, and the study of Chemistry is based on the study of the composition, properties, and structure of matter, including atomic structure and the changes influenced by chemical reactions.

New areas in chemistry, such as synthetic materials, natural resources, biomolecules, and industrial chemistry are also included in the course at the Class 11-12 level, ensuring that you get a thorough understanding of Chemistry fundamentals and contemporary developments. Practical lab experiments further serve to support your theoretical studies.

Examples of topics you will study are:

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure
Chemical Thermodynamics
Organic Chemistry
Chemical Kinetics
Surface Chemistry
Career options after studying chemistry include working in research, pharmaceuticals, healthcare as lab scientists, chemical engineers, biochemists, flavour chemists, analytical chemists, etc.

3. Biology
The term ‘Biology’ is derived from the Greek language, with ‘bios’ meaning life and ‘logos’ meaning study, literally translating into the study of life forms. And that’s exactly what biology is. Biology studies living organisms – plants and animals – including facets such as their physical structures, physiological mechanisms, chemical processes, molecular interactions, and development and evolution.

The subject of Biology at the Class 11-12 level focuses on providing a firm conceptual basis while also connecting the study of the subject with real-life technology, environment, agriculture, health, and industry.

Examples of topics you will study are:

Structural Organisation in Plants and Animals
Cell: Structure and Function
Plant Physiology
Human Physiology
Genetics and Evolution
Biotechnology and its Applications
Career opportunities after studying Biology are immense, including the most popular path of Medicine, whether MBBS or Ayurveda or Homeopathy. Apart from medicine, you can pursue a variety of career paths such as biotechnology, dentistry, veterinary sciences, pharmaceuticals, botany, zoology, marine biology, genetics, bioinformatics, microbiology, and more.</textarea>
